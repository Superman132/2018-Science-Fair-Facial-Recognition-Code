Science Fair code


# Caveats and Important Information before beginning
1. Only tested on python 3.6.4

2. Uses keras with tensorflow, takes at least an hour per training pass. 

3. Each file runs the specific model five times with random starting weights. 

4. The CNN model is currently do terrible compared to the results seen in all my research, as well as the MLP recieving really high results.


# Getting Started
1. Setup a default, cookie cutter Virtual Environment

2. Download the Extended Yale Database B from -> http://academictorrents.com/details/06e479f338b56fa5948c40287b66f68236a14612

3. Put the images from the database in a folder named ExtendedYaleB at the same level as the model python files.

4. Run the Convolutional Neural Network and Multi-Layer Perceptron. These will most likely create the text file, which shows the duration of training and the achieved accuracy.
